          Larry Broderick joined his beloved raptors soaring high in the air on
          December 31. Well-known in the birding community, Larry’s passion was
          introducing people to hawks and eagles; identifying species and
          plumage; and exploring habitats. He gave birding books to birding fans
          who followed him up hills, down to the sea, and across delta islands.
          The Jenner Headlands, Estero Americano, Lynch Canyon, and Tubbs Island
          were all on his list of favorite birding locations. But any rural road
          or fence line would do. <br /><br /> Larry was Coordinator & Editor at Bald Eagles
          of the North Bay and Beyond; Founder, Day Leader, and Co-manager at
          Jenner Headlands Hawkwatch; Independent Contractor at Solano Land
          Trust; Independent Contractor at Sonoma Land Trust; Director, Lead
          Visionary, Interpretive Guide, and Presenter at the West County
          HawkWatch Raptor Resource Page - Citizen Scientist Group; and a member
          of Madrone Audubon Society. <br /><br /> Larry loved his wife Sameth and their
          three sons even more than raptors. Larry served as his sons’ Cub Scout
          leader; was the loudest rooter at basketball and baseball games; and
          the hardest clapper at plays and concerts. He was proud of each son:
          16-year-old Elljay’s theatrical acting and SRHS Track and Field
          accomplishments; 15-year-old Preston’s baseball, basketball, and Santa
          Rosa Middle School’s Student Body Presidency; and 12-year-old Tyler’s
          Little League baseball and marimba playing. He loved his wife Sameth
          with passion, sharing 18 loving years with her as their family grew. <br /> <br />
          Larry alerted family and neighbors as the Tubbs Fire made its way down
          from Fountain Grove and stayed behind in a heroic effort to save his
          family’s and neighbors’ homes. Several weeks after the fire, on his
          way to work, he observed a runaway debris truck on fire hurtling down
          the Fountain Grove Expressway and crashing into cars. Again,
          heroically, he assisted injured people in exiting their burning
          vehicles. <br /> <br /> Larry’s passion for trains began with visits to his
          grandparents’ Oregon home overlooking the Southern Pacific Mainline,
          continued with collections of railroad books and models, and watching
          YouTube videos. Any train track was an excuse to stop and take a few
          pictures. <br /> <br /> Larry was born on December 13, 1965, in San Francisco and
          passed away at home in Santa Rosa on December 31, 2024, surrounded by
          his family. <br /> <br /> Larry is also survived by his loving parents, Nancy and
          Pat Broderick; his mourning sister Laurie and her husband Jim; niece
          Michaela and her husband Ryan, and grandniece Nora; and his Auntie Kay
          and Tom. He is also mourned by Sameth’s extended Prom family and his
          Broderick relatives. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry when you see a peregrine falcon
          perched on a fence post or an eagle soaring above the Jenner
          Headlands. When you attend a Santa Rosa High School Art Quest play,
          visit a Little League baseball game, or enjoy a Santa Rosa School
          District Marimba Band Concert, listen for his cheers and applause. His
          spirit lives on through his children’s lives and his wife’s memories. <br /> <br />
          Larry’s love of birds can also live on with a memorial contribution to
          any of the above raptor agencies or a bird support group of your
          choice. <br /> <br /> A Celebration of Larry’s Life is scheduled for 11:00 a.m.,
          Sunday, February 23, at the Hidden Valley Elementary School
          Multi-purpose Room.
